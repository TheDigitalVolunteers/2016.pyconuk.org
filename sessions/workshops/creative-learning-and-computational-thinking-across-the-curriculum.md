title: Learning How To Code from Scratch (aimed at parents, children, educators) - BYOD
---
Creative learning and computational thinking is being introduced across the curriculum in Wales which is great news. Everyone needs to embrace this with open arms as the outcomes are promising. Do you find the idea of coding intimidating and you don't know where to start? Well, I've been in that exact position on many occasions as a media teacher and a code club leader and emphathise completely. Newsflash - coding is very creative and fun! If you would like to have a quick introduction to the basic concepts of coding and to have a go building a chatbot or a game using Scratch, then this is the workshop for you as long as you bring your own device (BYOD). Install the Scratch app on your mobile device in advance just in case the Wifi is doggy and we can't get onto the Scratch website (ScratchJr is available as a free app for iPads and Android tablets). I will also have anecdotes of informal learning in after school coding clubs, and how digital volunteers have helped develop children's ability to learn creatively and use computational thinking techniques.
